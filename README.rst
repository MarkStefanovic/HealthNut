Calorie-tracking desktop app


Description
===========

This app was written in Kotlin using TornadoFX; and it heavily leverages TornadoFX's EventBus architecture to perform asynchronous
database calls, and to decouple views from their controllers. And it uses SQLExposed to interact with a SQLite backend.



Note
====

This app is currently just an experiment.  Usage details will be added if/when the app is fleshed out.
